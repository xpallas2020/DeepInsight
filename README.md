# DeepInsight
DeepInsight software stack can easily solve challenging industrial OCR, assembly verification, and random defect detection applications anywhere on the line that have gone uninspected because they are often too difficult to program with traditional, rule-based machine vision tools. It can be deployed on the smart camera platform which consisits of the industrial or common camera and the inference engine without the need for a PC, making deep learning technology accessible to non-programmers. It uses the familiar and easy-to-use web platform which simplifies application development and factory integration.
